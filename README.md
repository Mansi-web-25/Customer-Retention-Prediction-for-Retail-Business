This project aims to predict customer churn using historical purchase behavior and engagement metrics. By identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can proactively improve retention through targeted strategies.

## 💡 Objective

- Identify customers likely to churn based on purchase history
- Use machine learning models to classify churn risk
- Deliver actionable insights through Power BI dashboards

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- SQL (for data extraction and feature aggregation)
- Power BI (for visualization and business insights)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering on transaction and demographic data
- ML models: Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall
- Power BI dashboard for interactive insights
